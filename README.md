# Kaggle_Water_Potability
A Machine Learning Water Potability Project is an assess to predict the safety and quality of drinking water. This type of project aims to develop models that can automatically determine whether a given water sample is potable (safe for consumption) or non-potable (unsafe) based on various water quality parameters.
